# Mob Programming @ FCC Vienna
This is the repository for [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) done by members of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) Vienna.

Here we will share the code from our Mob Programming sessions, collect ideas for future sessions, and discuss anything related (open an Issue and discuss what you want to discuss, or reply to existing issues).
